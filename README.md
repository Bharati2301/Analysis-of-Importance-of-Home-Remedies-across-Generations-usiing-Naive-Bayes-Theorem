# Analysis-of-Importance-of-Home-Remedies-across-Generations-using-Naive-Bayes-Theorem

## INTRODUCTION
* Traditional medicine has been gradually forced underground in many societies due to pressure from missionaries and governments who perceived such practices as witchcraft.
* Contrary to those beliefs, however, traditional medicine has proven to be quite effective in treating both chronic diseases and psychological problems, especially those associated with stress, which frequently stem from social alienation, anxiety or loss of self-esteem.
* A standardised questionnaire was developed based on available literature and available questionnaires about knowledge and use of complementary and alternative medicine to collect information on most commonly used remedies in households.
* A total of 540 records of data was obtained which was later used for training the model.

## GRAPHS
* A graphical depiction of the percentages of persons who use home remedies for common ailments is shown below.
